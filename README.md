CS50 - Final Project - The 3d printing shop.

The 3D printing shop is a website for those, like my, are passionate about 3D printing.

In web site project, users will be able both to use it as an online shop to buy different fully functional and assembled printers and spare parts for the printers they may already have.

Also, the site gives the oportunity to users to submit their own (or downloaded from anywhere else) designs and I "will print" them according their choices as regards of materials and colors.
System will validate files provided are correct and "printable".

Finally, it offers a variety of contents where user could learn a bit more about this awesome technology in terms of printers types and filament offer.

Being said that, this is how I implemented it.

There's a registering part, where new users may register completing some basic info. From user pannel, they are able to change password, review orders, review printing jobs submitted, etc.

It's important to say that the site will check the info the user input is fine and, for instance, passwords match, user name is valid and available, etc. Also, at the moment of registering, user will be able to check terms and conditions for the site.

Once in the home page, there's a search bar where you can search for prodcuts by any keyword and, in case you know exactly what are you looking for, there's a catalog for parts and filaments, sorted by types.

On the bottom, there's support info section as well as links to the main external sites where I've taken part of the info from.

Adding items to the cart, will be limited to the product availability, which means you will be able to add as many parts as our stock allows you to do so.

From shopping cart section, you'll be able to add or remove items (adding more units for a particular items will depend on stock availability) and also remove them in case you regret of having that.

Product stock will be updated after check out and not after adding an item to the cart.

Finally, during check out user will be prompted to input some promo code (CS50 one will gets you 10 bucks off!). User will also be prompted to input shipping info (and billing info is he/she wants to) and down in the page, the payment method.

After placing an order, there's an option to review previous orders and products within them, linking products to detailed description and technical specs.

Any time the user makes a mistake with the input, our beloved grumpy cat will let you know you made something wrong.

That's pretty much it!
